# OpenGLStarterProject
This is a starter project for OpenGL in C++.  
It includes:  
- glfw  
- glew  
- glm  
- imgui
  
It also has theses scripts:  
- VertexBuffer.h<br>For creating a vertex buffer.
- VertexBufferLayout.h<br>For diffining how the data is structured in a vertex buffer.
- IndexBuffer.h<br>For creating an index buffer.
- VertexArray.h<br>For creating a vertex array.
- Renderer.h<br>For rendering on the screen.
- Shader.h<br>For creating a program with a vertex and fragment shader.
- Texture.h<br>For creating a texture.

This repository is mostly for me so I don't have to go through the effort of linking all of the libraries and stuff, but, you can use it too.  
Most of the code used is from [The Cherno's](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno) [OpenGL tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2).

If you want to rename it, just rename the solution and project files, then build the solution.  
If you get errors trying to include **GLFW** or **GLEW**, right click on the *dependencies* folder and hit **Include In Project**
