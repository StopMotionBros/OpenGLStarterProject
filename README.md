# OpenGLStarterProject
This is a starter project for OpenGL in C++.  
It includes:  
- glfw  
- glew  
- glm  
- imgui
  
It also has theses scripts:  
- VertexBuffer.h<br>For creating a vertex buffer.
- VertexBufferLayout.h<br>For diffining how the data is structured in a vertex buffer.
- IndexBuffer.h<br>For creating an index buffer.
- VertexArray.h<br>For creating a vertex array.
- Renderer.h<br>For rendering on the screen.
- Shader.h<br>For creating a program with a vertex and fragment shader.
- Texture.h<br>For creating a texture.

This repository is for me so I don't have to go through the effort of linking all of the libraries and stuff.  
Most of the code used is from [The Cherno's OpenGL tutorial series.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2)
